Vietnamese Avocado Smoothie Recipe (Sinh Tố Bơ)

## Ingredients
* 1 medium Haas avocado sliced and frozen
* ½ c ice
* ⅓ c milk (add more if you want to thin smoothie)
* ¼ c condensed milk (add more if you want a sweeter smoothie)

## Directions
* To make the frozen avocado slices, cut ripe avocados in medium sized slices. Line a sheet pan with wax paper and place the avocado slices individually on the pan. Place this sheet in the freezer for one hour. When they have frozen, you can use them for the smoothie or put them in a freezer safe container.
* To make the smoothie, add all the ingredients into a strong blender. Consistency should be super thick with small chunks of the frozen avocados.
* This ratio is not too sweet, but you can adjust the amount of condensed milk for a sweeter taste. To make this a smoother consistency, you can add more milk too.
* Pour the smoothie into a glass and eat with a straw or spoon (it’s that thick!).
