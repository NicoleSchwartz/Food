•Ingredients for 10 people
•500 gr of mascarpone cheese ( is a kind of cheese very creamy  , white color, smell of cream, butter and yogurt, taste sweet but not cloying. Do not use other types of cheese or one not Italian made because the final result will depend very much on the quality of this ingredient. If you don’t find it write me and I’ll send you the recipe to do it at home)
•4 eggs
•4 or 5 tablespoons of sugar ( white)
•Savoiardi biscuits (  they are very crumbly and spongy biscuits perfect to be the basis of our dessert)
•Black strong coffee
•Powder of bitter cocoa 


•1) divide carefully the white egg to the yolk ( if a single drop of yolk or other fatty ingredient go on the white egg will be then impossible to whip )
•2) whip the yolk with the sugar ( in my personal version the yolk is not too much whipped, the consistency is more than a cream but much less than a yoghurt)
•3) now added the mascarpone to the whipped yolks, do it slowly a little a time with planetary movements  from bottom to top. ( be carefully, the secret is to combine the mascarpone whiteout drop the volume of the whipped eggs.)
•4) put the biscuit on the bottom of a glass to cover it completel

•5)  wet the biscuits with unsweetened coffee
•6)  whips firm  the white eggs, eventually add some sugar for helping the process ( pay attention to the temperature of the white egg because if they are cold they are very difficult to whips. I suggest working the whites at room temperature)
•7) add the whipped white eggs to the eggs yolk and mascarpone. Using the same method as in point 3
•8) according to personal taste add small flakes of dark chocolate
•9) now fill the glasses with our tiramisu
•10) finishing the top whit unsweetened cocoa powder, finally let rest for few hours in the fridge I suggest 24.

Do not settle for ingredients similar to the original one, remember that the result depend (minimum) 50% on the quality of the ingredient
•Use fresh eggs
•Be carefull that no residue of yolk (or other fats) contaminates the white eggs. In case impossible to wipp!
•When wipp egg  don’t change the direction of the wipp’s
•When assembly wipped egg yolk to wipped with egg be careful with movements from bottom to top
•Working on bowl in terracotta (ceramic) container NOT in plastic
