## Notes
* Dec 18 2018 - attempted to substitute all purpose flour + 1.5 tsp baking powder, was not right too moist
* Mar 24 2019 - manischewitz matzo cake meal http://manischewitz.com/products/cake-meal-canister/ less moist but still moist, also somehow less batter so harder to get full coverage of bottom of pan and top layer, but delicious
