## Ingredients
* ¼ cup sesame seeds
* ½ cup sugar
* 2 cups glutinous rice flour
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup grated mature coconut
* water for boiling

## Directions
* In a pan over medium heat, toast sesame seeds, stirring frequently, for about 30 to 40 seconds or until lightly browned and fragrant. Remove from heat and allow to cool. 
* In a bowl, combine toasted sesame seeds and sugar. Set aside.
* In a bowl, combine rice flour and water and mix into a soft, pliable dough. 
* Divide the dough into portions and using the palm of hands, shape into balls and then flatten into oval disks about ¼-inch thick.
* In a pot over medium heat, bring about 5-inch deep of water into a rolling boil.
* Individually drop the rice patties into the boiling water, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until the patties float to the surface, 
* Using a slotted spoon, remove from the water and drain well. Arrange in a single layer on a parchment-lined platter to keep from sticking together and let cool just enough to touch.
* While still warm, roll the palitaw on grated coconut to fully coat. 
* Sprinkle with sesame-sugar mixture before serving.
