## Ingredients, CARAMILIZED APPLES
* 2 medium apples (peeled, cored and chopped)
* 2 tablespoon butter (30 grams)
* 1/3 cup lightly packed brown sugar (60 grams)
* 1 tablespoon water
* 1/2-1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (if desired)

## Ingredients, cake
* 1 3/4 cups + 1 tablespoon cake/pastry flour (240 grams)
* 1 pinch salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 large egg (room temperature)
* 1 large egg yolk (room temperature)
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* 1/3 cup brown sugar (lightly packed)
* 1/2 cup butter melted (cooled) (110 grams)
* 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt (room temperature) (125 grams)

For room temperature remove the ingredients from the fridge 30-45 minutes before using.

## Directions
* In a medium pot or skillet over low heat melt the butter then add the brown sugar, water and chopped apples, stir together and cook for about 3 minutes over medium/high heat just to melt the sugar, then lower to medium/low and cook for another 5-10 minutes. Add the cinnamon if using in the last two of minutes of cooking time. Stir often, apples should be tender but not mushy.

## Directions
* Pre-heat oven to 350F (180C). Grease and flour an 8 inch cake pan.
* Whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon. Set aside.
* In a large bowl beat together the sugars, egg and egg yolk until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes, then add the yogurt and melted butter and beat together, 1 minute.
* Add the flour mixture to the beaten egg mixture and beat until smooth, do not over beat. Gently fold in the caramelized apples then spoon into the prepared pan.
* Bake for approximately 30-40 minutes or until toothpick (in the cake part) comes out clean or a couple of crumbs are attached and let cool completely or eat warm. You can serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a light dusting of powdered sugar. Enjoy!

## Notes
* To make your own cake/pastry flour, for every cup of all purpose flour remove two tablespoons and replace with 2 tablespoons of corn starch. Sift together before using.
