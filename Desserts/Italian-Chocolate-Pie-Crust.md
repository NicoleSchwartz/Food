Italian Chocolate Pie Crust/Pasta Frolla
## Ingredients
* 2¼ cups all purpose flour (292 grams)
* 1 pinch salt (If using unsalted butter then add ¼ teaspoon of salt.)
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* ½ cup granulated sugar (100 grams)
* 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa (sifted)
* 1 large egg (room temperature)
* 1 large egg yolk (room temperature)
* ½ cup +2 tablespoons butter cubed (room temperature) (150 grams)

## Directions
* In a large bowl, mixing bowl or food processor bowl add the flour, salt, baking powder, sugar and sifted cocoa (it can be sifted directly into the bowl), mix together with a whisk. 
* Add the egg, yolk and butter, combine with the flat beater, pulsing or with a fork or clean hands until almost combined.
* Move to a lightly floured flat surface and gently knead a couple of times just to bring it together. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate 30-60 minutes.
* Roll the dough either for your pie recipe or add some chocolate chips or even nuts and make some cut out cookies, chill the cookies while the oven is pre-heated at 350F (180C) and bake 10-12 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheet. Enjoy!

## Notes
* It might be best to start with 2 cups of flour and adding a tablespoon at a time if needed. Sometimes it depends on the flour and how it absorbs liquids.
For room temperature ingredients remove from the fridge 45-60 minutes before using.
