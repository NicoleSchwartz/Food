## Ingredients

### Dough
* 1 cup warm milk (about 115 degrees F)
* 2 1/2 teaspoons instant dry yeast (I like Red Star Platinum Baking Yeast)
_Different yeast calls for slightly different proofing methods. We follow Red Star Platinum’s temperature guidelines. Please check your yeast packet to see what temperature the milk should be at._
* 2 large eggs at room temperature
* 1/2cup salted butter (Melted, but make sure it isn't super hot. Just barely melted, or even softened, is fine.)
_A note about the butter, we have used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/3 cup many times. We feel it keeps the rolls softer. Give it a try!_
* 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (divided)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar

### Filling
* 1/2 cup salted butter (almost melted)
* 1 cup packed brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons cinnamon
* 1/2 cup heavy cream (for pouring over the risen rolls_
_If you don’t have cream, use half and half, coffee creamer, evaporated milk, whole milk or coconut cream. Any of these will work. Even 2% milk will work, but we prefer a higher fat milk._

### Frosting
* 6 ounces cream cheese (softened)
* 1/3 cup salted butter (softened)
* 2 cups powdered sugar
* 1/2 tablespoon maple extract (or vanilla)

## Directions
### Dough
* Pour the warm milk in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast overtop.
* Add the eggs, butter, salt and sugar.
* Add in 4 cups (save the other 1/2 cup and add only if you need it) of flour and mix using the beater blade just until the ingredients are barely combined. Allow the mixture to rest for 5 minutes so the flour has time to soak up the liquids.
* Scrape the dough off the beater blade and remove it. Attach the dough hook.
* Beat the dough on medium speed, adding in up to 1/2 cup more flour if needed to form a dough. Knead for 5-7 minutes or until the dough is elastic and smooth. **The dough should be tacky and will still be sticking to the sides of the bowl. That's ok! Don't be tempted to add more flour at this point. We generally add about 4 1/2 cups, but start with 4 cups.
* Spray a large bowl with cooking spray.
* Use a rubber spatula to remove the dough from the mixer bowl and place it in the greased large bowl. 
* Cover the bowl with a towel or wax paper.

### Rise
* Set the bowl in a warm place and allow the dough to rise until double. I like to turn on the oven to the lowest setting for 1-2 minutes. Then turn off the oven and place the dough to rise in there. It normally takes about 30 minutes for the dough to rise. Do not allow the dough to rise too much or your cinnamon rolls will be airy.

### Filling
* While the dough is rising, prepare the cinnamon filling. In a medium bowl, combine the soft butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, mixing until well combined. Set aside.

### End rise
* Sprinkle a pastry mat generously with flour. Turn out the dough onto the pastry mat and sprinkle the top of the dough with additional flour. 
* Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough to about a 24×15" rectangle. (the size of the rectangle can vary…it does not have to be exact!)
* Use a rubber spatula to smooth the cinnamon filling over the whole dough rectangle.
* Starting on the long end, roll the dough up tightly jelly roll style. 
* Cut into 12 slices and place in a greased 9×13 baking pan. _For smaller rolls, cut the dough into 15 slices and use a 10×15″ baking pan. The larger pan will also allow the rolls to rise more evenly._
* Cover the pan and allow the rolls to rise for 20 minutes or until nearly double.
* Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
* Warm the heavy cream until the chill is off. Don’t make it hot…you just don’t want it cold. It should be warm to the touch.
* Once the rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over the top of the rolls, allowing it to soak down in and around the rolls.
* Bake at 375 degrees for 20-22 minutes, until the rolls are lightly golden brown and the center rolls are cooked through. Note…the time will vary based on how big the rolls are, what type of pan, how close the rolls are packed, etc. They could take up to 25-27 minutes. Check the rolls at 20 minutes. If they are getting too browned, cover loosely with foil for the remaining baking time.
* While the rolls are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting.
* In a large bowl, combine the softened cream cheese and butter using a hand mixer. Blend well.
* Add in your favorite extract and the powdered sugar. Beat until combined.
* Spread the frosting over the cooled rolls.
* Store in an airtight container.

## Notes

### Overnight Instructions
* We often make the cinnamon rolls and get them to the point of the second rise (when they are rolled out, cut up and put in the pan). Cover and refrigerate until morning.
* The morning you want to bake them, pull them out of the refrigerator. They may have doubled in size in the fridge overnight. If they have, let them sit for 30 minutes to get the chill off, then bake.
* If they did not rise in the fridge overnight, allow them to rise at room temperature. Plan about at least an hour for this. Then pour on the cream and let them bake.
* The Calorie count shows the amount with ALL of the frosting used. There will be less calories in the rolls if you don’t use all of the frosting at once. Calories are per roll with the recipe making 12 frosted rolls.

### Freezing - can you freeze cinnamon roll dough before baking?
* Yes! Make the cinnamon rolls and get them to the point of the second rise (when they are rolled out, cut up and put in the pan). Place them on a pan (not touching) and put them in the freezer for about 1 hour. Then place the rolls in a zippered bag.
* When you’re ready to bake the rolls, plan ahead and put the rolls in the fridge to defrost overnight. Then pull them out of the refrigerate and allow them to rise the morning you want to bake them. Plan about at least an hour for this so you aren’t waiting too long! Allow them to do their second rise, then bake as normal.
