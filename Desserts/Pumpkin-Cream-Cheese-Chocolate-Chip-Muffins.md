Pumpkin Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip Muffins

## Ingredients
* 1 3/4 cup all purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice
* 1 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 can pumpkin - 15 oz
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 8 oz cream cheese, softened
* 1/3 cup powdered sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 cup mini semi sweet chocolate chips. I use a light 3/4 of a cup.  You can go as low as 1/2 cup.

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
* Line muffin tin(s) with 24 foil muffin cup liners and set aside.
* In a small bowl, mix the room temperature cream cheese, egg, powdered sugar and vanilla together with a hand mixer or a whisk until smooth.
* Mix in 3 Tbsp of miniature chocolate chips. Set aside.
* In a medium mixing bowl, cream the pumpkin, oil, eggs, and brown sugar until well combined.
* In a large mixing bowl, add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and pumpkin pie spice. Stir with a whisk until fully combined.
* Add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir ONLY until all ingredients are incorporated. Batter will look lumpy, that is fine.
* Stir in the remainder of the chocolate chips.
* Fill muffin tins 2/3 full of the pumpkin batter.
* Drop 2-3 teaspoons of the cream cheese mixture onto each muffin top. Swirl cream cheese mixture into the top of the muffin with a butter knife or toothpick.
* Bake for 25-28 minutes.
* Remove from oven and cool muffins on cooling rack.
* Store leftovers in a air tight container or freeze them in a freezer bag for later use.

## Notes
* (I always use the foil muffin cup liners because the muffins always come out clean and whole. I often find with paper liners that the muffin sticks to it and you loose half of your muffin.)
