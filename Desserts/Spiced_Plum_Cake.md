Spiced Plum Cake

## Ingredients
* 1/2 cup Light Olive oil
* 3/4 cup Light Brown sugar
* 2 Eggs
* 1 tsp Vanilla Flavoring
* 1 cup All-Purpose Flour
* 1 tsp Baking Powder
* 1/2 tsp Ground Cardamom
* 1/2 tsp Ground Cinnamon
* 2 tbsp Fresh Orange juice & zest

## Ingredients, Plum Topping
* 4 Red Plums, ripe, cut into 8 sliced
* 1/4 cup Slivered Almonds
* 1/2 tsp Ground Cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp Ground Ginger
* 1/2 Orange's juice
* 1 tbsp Brown Sugar

## Directions
* In a bowl, mix together all the ingredients for the plum topping. Set aside as you work on the batter.
* In another large bowl, cream together the sugar and olive oil. Then, beat the eggs and vanilla with the sugar and olive oil. I do this using a paddle attachment with my kitchenaid.
* Add the fresh orange juice and zest along with the cardamom and cinnamon. Give it a quick mix.
* Then, add the flour and baking powder and stir until you have a creamy batter
* Place the cake batter in an 8 inch greased baking pan preferally springform.
* Top the batter with the plum slices skin side up and overall plum topping mixture to cover the top of the cake batter. You can do this in uniform or freehand.
* Bake in a 350 F for about 50-55 minutes. This is dependent on your oven. The cake would be lightly browned and baked throughout.
* Allow for the cake to cool before taking out of the pan and slicing. Enjoy as is or with a dollop and fresh whipped cream with a sprinkle of cinnamon.
* Store leftovers room temperatture covered for one day or in the fridge for 2-3 days. This is best fresh, same day.

* This cake can be made with other seasonal fruits such as peaches. Fruits must be ripe as that is when they are naturally sweet and quicker to bake.
