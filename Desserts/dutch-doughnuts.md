## Ingredients
* 1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1/2 cup lukewarm water
* 4 1/2 teaspoons instant dry yeast
* 4 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 large eggs
* 2 cups milk
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 8 cups oil (vegetable or sunflower, for frying)
* Garnish: Confectioners' sugar
* Garnish: Ground cinnamon

## Directions
* In a small bowl, mix 1 teaspoon white sugar into the water. Sprinkle the yeast on top and allow to stand for 10 minutes (if the yeast doesn't bubble, discard and buy new yeast. The lack of bubbles means the yeast is no longer active).
* Mix together the flour and remaining 1/4 cup white sugar in a large bowl and make a well in the middle. Add the eggs and the yeast mixture to the well.
* Warm up the milk in the microwave just until it is lukewarm. Add half of the milk to the well in the flour and mix until all the ingredients are combined. Add the rest of the milk and mix until smooth.
* Cover the bowl with a damp dishtowel and allow to rise in a warm area for about 1 hour. Once the dough has doubled, stir in the salt and let sit while you heat the oil.
* Heat the oil to 350 F in a large, deep pan or in a deep fryer. To check whether the oil is at the right temperature, stand the handle of a wooden spoon in the oil. If little bubbles form around it, the oil is ready.
* Quickly dip two tablespoons into the oil and form small balls of the dough with the oiled tablespoons, carefully scraping and dropping the dough into the hot oil. The oliebollen will sink to the bottom of the pan and then pop right back up. You should be able to fry at least 6 at a time, but don't crowd the pan.
* Fry until golden brown on both sides, carefully flipping when required. Drain on a tray lined with paper towels.
* Sieve confectioners' sugar over the oliebollen as well as a dusting of ground cinnamon and serve warm.
