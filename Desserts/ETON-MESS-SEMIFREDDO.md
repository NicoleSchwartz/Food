ETON MESS SEMIFREDDO

## Ingredients
* 500ml/2 cups whipping cream/double cream
* 397g/14 oz sweetened condensed milk
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 150g/5 oz fresh strawberries
* 4 meringue nest ready made, broken into small pieces
* Strawberry coulis optional

## Directions
* In a large bowl combine whipping cream and sweet and condensed milk with good quality vanilla.
* Whip until soft peaks form, don't over-beat, we are not looking for a whipped cream here.
* Chop strawberries finely or quickly pulse them in the food processor, drain the juice.
* Crumble store bought meringue with your hands or use a rolling pin.
* Gently fold strawberries into the cream mixture, then add broken meringue.
* Line a loaf pan with a cling film or aluminium foil with the ends over-hanging for easy un-moulding and fill it with the cream mixture.
* Bring the cling film ends over to cover the top of the semifreddo, then wrap the whole pan in double layer of aluminium foil.
* Freeze over night. For easy un-moulding, let your semifreddo sit on your countertop for a few minutes, then put your serving dish on top of the loaf pan and quickly turn it over, peel the cling film off and top with additional strawberries.
* You may drizzle it with some strawberry coulis, jam or sauce for extra drama.
