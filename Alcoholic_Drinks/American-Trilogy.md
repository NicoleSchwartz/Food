- 1 oz Rye
- 1 oz (Lairdâ€™s) Apple Brandy
- 1/4-1/3 oz Simple Syrup (the recipe calls for a muddled sugar cube, but simple syrup mixes so much easier)
- 4 dashes of Orange Bitters
- Orange Peel for garnish


Pour all ingredients in a shaker or mixing glass with ice and chill well. Strain into a cocktail glass and garnish with an orange peel. As always, make sure you cut your peel over the serving glass to express the zest from the orange over the drink.
