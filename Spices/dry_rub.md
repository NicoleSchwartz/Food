Dry Rub Seasoning

Original recipe by Walter Jetton, substitution by my grandfather Hinton.

This is for sprinkling on ribs and other meats 1 to 2 hours before you barbecue them. 
Use heaping measures when you are mixing it and do not skimp when you use it.

6 Tablespoons of Salt
6 Tablespoons of Sugar
1 Tablespoon of Lemon Powder (or grated peel)
2.5 Tablespoons of Black Pepper
1 Tablespoon of Paprika
2 Tablespoons of MSG

Makes about 12 ounces.
