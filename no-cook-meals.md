When it's too hot to cook inside here are some options for dinners

H/T to @curtisko @armytrixter @RachelRecruitin @FirmWarez @clevrcat @improbablyadev @quadling @datSecuritychic

## Cooking Method Suggestions

- grill or fire pit (you can put foil packets, pizza stones, dutch ovens and cast iron on it to diversify!)
- sous vide
- instapot (let them steam out outside)

Note: I have a burn ban in place, and we do not have an instapot, grill or sous vide so my menu choices were influenced by that

* cucumber and onion salad. Sliced cucumber and onion in 1/2 and 1/2 water and vinegar, with a little sugar and salt. Chill overnight. Sprinkle with black pepper, or Cavenders for that real from the Ozarks flavor.
* gazpacho https://www.foodiecrush.com/traditional-gazpacho-recipe/
* cucumbers sliced or diced, carrot slivers, green onions sliced, sesame seeds with peanut dressing. (Peanut butter, mirin if unsweet or vinegar if sweetened pb, sambal garlic chili paste. Mix until liquid).
* any coleslaw type.
* tomatoes, cucumber, onion, feta, garbanzos!
* Spring roll wraps with peanut sauce is a good no-heat meal. 
  * Shove a bunch of chopped veggies in em, roll like a burrito, and dip em in a delicious peanut sauce.

Note my family will not eat spicy, cilantro, peppers (yes bell included), tuna, or avacado so the below are out for us! (Also the bagels here are also terrible.)

* tuna salad, then keep it chilly 
* bagels, cream cheese and lox (and capers and onions and tomatoes)

* corn salsa- raw fresh corn, diced cherry tomatoes, avocado, diced onion, cilantro, dash of olive oil, two dashes lime juice, salt (and cumin if you like it). Eat with tortilla chips. Or a spoon. Can add black beans.
