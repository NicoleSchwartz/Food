mashed potato and carrot

## Ingredients
* 100 g onions (chopped)
* 150 g carrots (chopped)
* 300g potatoes (peeled and halved) 
* Curry powder
* Water for cooking
* Butter for frying
* Salt and pepper
* Optional: gravy, rookworst/meat

## Directions
* Cook potatoes and carrots in a pot with water until both are soft. Drain.
* Fry the onions in a pan with butter until soft and glazed.
* Add a lot of curry powder to the onions (a bit more than you might think, cause the potatoes will balance it out)
* Att the onions with the juices from the onions and butter to the pan of potatoes and carrots
* Mash everything together until the desired consistency (I like mine a bit lumpy still)
* Season with pepper and salt, give it a good stir
* Serve as is or with gravy and rookworst (or a different type of meat)
