Soft Dinner Rolls Recipe

## Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1/2-3/4 teaspoons salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 2 1/4 cups + 1 tablespoon of all purpose flour* (divided) (300 grams)
* 1/2 cup milk (room temperature) (120 grams)
* 2 tablespoons butter softened
* 1 large egg (room temperature)
* 2-3 tablespoons butter (melted) for brushing

*If needed add more flour but 1 tablespoon at a time. I only needed the flour amount that is written.

## Directions
* In the bowl of the stand up mixer whisk together the sugar, salt, yeast and 3/4 cup of flour.
* In a medium pot heat the milk to 120F (48C), remove from heat and add the butter and let it melt, cool to 105F (40C).
* Once cooled add to the whisked ingredients and beat with the flat beaters for 2 minutes, then add the egg and 1/4 cup flour, beat 1 minute. Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups + 1 tablespoon of flour, change to the dough hook and knead for about 5-7 minutes, dough should be soft, smooth and elastic (if still too wet add a tablespoon of flour at a time, dough should be soft so do not over flour).
* Place the dough on a lightly floured flat surface and form into a dough ball. Place in a lightly oiled bowl and roll the ball to lightly cover in oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm draft free area until doubled in bulk, about 1-2 hours.
* Punch the dough down and shape into 9 equal balls (about 58 grams each or just over 2 ounces). Place just touching in a greased 8 or 9 inch (20 or 22 cm) square pan, cover the pan and let rise in a warm draft free area for 1 hour.
* Pre-heat oven to 350F (180C).
* Brush the rolls with melted butter and bake for approximately 20 minutes or until golden. Brush again with melted butter if desired. Let cool on a wire rack or serve warm. Enjoy!

## Notes
* Dough can also be kneaded by hand, knead for about 10 minutes or until dough is soft, smooth and elastic.
* For room temperature, remove the ingredients from the fridge 30-45 minutes before using.
