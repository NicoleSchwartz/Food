Cucumbers in Spicy Peanut Sauce

## Ingredients #1
* 2 large English cucumbers sliced about 1/3rd inch thick
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup chopped peanuts, toasted
* 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 2 tablespoons peanut butter
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon dried red chili flakes
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

## Directions
* Place the sliced cucumbers into a mixing bowl. Sprinkle in the salt and toss to coat. Transfer the cucumbers to a colander for one hour, allowing the excess water to drain.
* In the meantime, measure the soy sauce, vinegar, peanut butter, honey, garlic, dried red chili flakes, and ground black pepper into a small mixing bowl and whisk to combine.
* Once the cucumbers have drained for one hour, transfer them to a bowl along with the peanuts, parsley, and sauce mixture. Toss well to coat. Serve immediately.
* If making ahead of time, cover well and refrigerate for no more than 8 hours. Bring to room temperature and toss well before serving because the peanut sauce may settle at the bottom of the bowl.
