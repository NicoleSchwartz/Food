## Ingredients
* 7.7oz (1 cup) warm water (90 degrees)
* 0.5 oz (1T +1/2 t) active dry yeast
* 0.5 oz (1T +1/2 t) sugar
* 0.90 oz - plain yogurt (or heavy cream or sour cream) 13.70 oz (2.5 cups) bread flour
* 0.25 oz (3/4 t) salt
* 4 ounces butter
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, finely chopped

## Directions
* Preheat pizza stone at 550+ degrees.
* Using a digital scale in ounces and a stand mixer with a hook attachment, put the mixing bowl on the scale and press TARE.
* With the readout now at 0 ounces, add the warm water, yeast, and sugar, pressing TARE in between each ingredient. Hand-mix with a whisk to dissolve yeast and sugar.
* Return bowl to scale and add in the rest of the ingredients in order.
* Using stand mixer, mix on speed #1 or #2 for 10 minutes or by hand for 15 minutes. The dough should feel pillowy, like a soft memory foam pillow. Round dough into a smooth ball. Oil a large mixing bowl; place dough into it and cover with plastic.
* Portion out dough into 6 equal parts, roll into duffs, and bench (rest) for 5 min. After benching, duffs should have grown and feel “pillow-like” to the touch.
* Dough is ready to be shaped, dressed, and baked. Roll out with rolling pin.
* Make the ‘blessing’ by combining and melting the butter, garlic, and cilantro. Use a microwave or range. Salt and pepper to taste.
* Bake both sides on stone, take it out and ‘bless’ it with the melted butter using a pastry brush.
* Keep naan in tinfoil wrapped in a hand towel to keep warm until service.
