HONEY GARLIC BUTTER ROASTED CARROTS

## Ingredients
* 2 pounds (1 kg) carrots washed and peeled (or unpeeled)
* 1/3 cup butter
* 3 tablespoons honey
* 4 garlic cloves minced
* 1/4-1/2 teaspoon salt plus more for seasoning
* Cracked black pepper

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking oil spray; set aside.
* Trim ends of carrots and cut into thirds.
* Melt butter in a pan or skillet over medium-heat. Pour in honey and cook, while stirring, until completely melted through the butter. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant while stirring.
* Add the carrots and allow the sauce to thicken for a further minute, while tossing the carrots through the sauce. Season with salt and pepper. 
* Transfer carrots to baking sheet in a single layer so they cook evenly. Toss to evenly coat.
* Roast for 20 minutes, or until carrots are fork-tender. Broil (or grill) for 2-3 minutes on high heat to crisp/char the edges.
* OPTIONAL: Transfer them back into the skillet and allow carrots to simmer in the sauce over high heat for 5 minutes to thicken the sauce into a glaze. *SEE NOTES.
