Sabudana Khichdi

## Ingredients
* 1 cup sabudana 180 grams, sago pearls
* 1 cup water 8 oz
* 1 tablespoon oil use oil of choice, I used avocado oil
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 medium potato 200 grams, diced small, around 1 cup diced potatoes
* 2 tablespoons raw peanuts
* 1-2 green chili chopped, adjust to taste
* 6-7 curry leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste, use sendha namak if making this for fast
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar optional
* juice of 1/2 lemon
* 1 tablespoon cilantro chopped
* yogurt

## Directions
* Rinse sabudana under water until water turns clear. This is important to get rid of all the starch.
* Transfer the rinsed sabudana to a large bowl and add 1 cup water to it. No more.
* In the morning the sabudana would have soaked up all the water. But you still drain it using a colander just to get rid of any excess water.
* To check if sabudana is ready to cook, press a pearl between your thumb and index finger. It should smash easily. Set it aside.
* Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for few seconds.
* Then add the diced potatoes and cook for 3-4 minutes stirring often until potatoes are almost cooked. It's important to dice the potatoes small here so that cook quickly.
* Add the raw peanuts and for another 2-3 minutes.
* Then add the green chili, curry leaves and cook for 1 more minute.
* Add the drained sabudana to the pan along with salt and sugar. Mix until well combined.
* Cook for few minutes until most of the sabudana pearls become translucent, stirring once or twice. Do not cook it for a long time else it will become sticky. 
* Remove pan from heat. Add lemon juice and cilantro and toss to combine.
* Serve sabudana khichdi hot with chilled yogurt.
