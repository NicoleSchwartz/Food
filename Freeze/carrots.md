How to Freeze Carrots the Right Way—and Keep Them Fresh for Months

## Directions
* Wash and prep: Rinse the carrots under water to remove dirt, trim the tops, and peel.
* Slice, dice, or chop: Leave small carrots whole, and cut larger ones into thin slices, cubes, or lengthwise strips, depending on your preference.
* Blanch, cool, and drain: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the carrots and blanch the small whole carrots for 5 minutes, or sliced, diced, or strip-cut carrots for 2 minutes. Drain with a spider strainer, transfer to a large bowl of ice water to cool, then drain again.
* Dry: Pat the carrots dry and place them in a single, even layer on a baking sheet. Place in the freezer for 1 to 2 hours, or until frozen.
* Seal and freeze: Transfer the carrots to a freezer-safe bag with about 1/2 inch of headspace. Seal the bags and put them back in the freezer.
