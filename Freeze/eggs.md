Freeze Eggs

## Directions
* To freeze whole eggs, you need to "beat just until blended, pour into freezer containers, seal tightly, label with the number of eggs, and date, then freeze," said Elisa Maloberti, the food safety manager at the American Egg Board — advising against freezing hard-boiled eggs as the egg whites become tough and watery.

* Maloberti also says egg yolks or whole eggs should be used as soon as they’re thawed. Meanwhile, thawed egg whites will beat to a better volume if you allow them to sit at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes.
