Apple Grilled Cheese

## Ingredients
- Quarter of apple sliced thinly
- Sourdough bread
- Gouda cheese (whatever cheese)
- Honey (optional: Hot Honey)
- Garlic
- Lemon juice
- Butter
- olive oil
- salt
- cayenne
- onion (optional)

## Directions
1. cooked the apples and onions in butter and olive oil with a sprinkle of salt and cayenne
2. Then I put the cheeses, honey, squeeze of lemon, and apples on between the bread 
3. Put a couple garlic cloves in the butter/oil (just long enough to flavor the oil, but take them out before they burn)
4. Brown both sides of the bread on high heat
5. Lower the stove, squeeze some lemon juice around the pan and put a lid on the pan (the lemon makes a tangy steam room for the cheese to melt in)
6. Before you eat, rub the garlic cloves on both sides of the bread
