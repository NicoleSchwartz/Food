## Ingredients
* 12 strawberries
* 2 kiwis
* 1 navel orange
* 4 slices shokupan (Japanese pullman loaf bread)

## Ingredients, Whipped Cream
* 1 cup heavy (whipping) cream
* 5 tsp sugar (10% of heavy cream)
* 1 tsp rum (optional)

## Directions, prepare fruit
* Remove the core of strawberries.
* Cut off both ends and peel the skin of the kiwis.
* Cut off both ends of the navel orange. Remove the peel. Carefully peel off the segment wall and get each segment out.
* Using a paper towel, remove the moisture of the fruits.

## Directions, whipped cream
* Prepare a large bowl of iced water and place a medium bowl inside the larger bowl to keep cool. Make sure the bowl is clean and dry. Add the heavy whipping cream and start whisking on low speed.
* Once bubbly, add sugar and rum (if you are using) and start whisking on medium-high speed.
* When you lift the whisk out of the cream and shows peaks, remove the bowl from the ice bath and switch to a hand whisk. Whisk until you achieve the right consistency. Check the consistency of the whipped cream as you whisk. It should be spreadable but not runny because it goes between the sandwich bread.

## Directions
* Now spread the whipped cream on both sides of the sandwich bread. If there is any leftover whipped cream, you can dip your fruits or make Fruit Parfait. I prefer to keep the crust on the bread until the end. When you put fruits between two slices of the bread, the crust helps to keep it in shape.
* Only on one side of the sandwich bread, align the fruits. I plan to cut the sandwich diagonally. Think carefully about how you want to show your cross section. I recommend taking a picture of the alignment of the fruits and don’t change the orientation of the sandwich.
* Put the whipped cream to fill in any gap between fruits.
* Put the second slices of sandwich bread over the fruits, facing the whipped cream side down.
* Prepare plastic wrap, large enough to wrap the sandwich tightly from all four sides. Remember, don’t change the orientation of the sandwich.
* Mark the cross section over the plastic wrap with a pen.
* Put the sandwiches between plates and refrigerate for at least one hour (up to overnight). In Japan, putting weight on the sandwich is a pretty standard method prior to cutting in half.
* Open the plastic wrap and cut the sandwich in half diagonally with a clean knife. Keep it closed (Don’t open the sandwich to show cross section yet). Clean the knife with a hot wet towel before each cut.
* Gently press down the sandwich and cut off the 4 edges.
* Serve immediately. If you plan to transfer the sandwich, make sure to keep it chilled all times.
