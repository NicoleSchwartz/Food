* For the confit tuna, place the olive oil, spices and citrus rinds in a small heavy-based saucepan over low heat. Using a probe thermometer as a guide, slowly bring the temperature to 70°C. Once the oil has reached temperature, add the tuna and remove the pan from the heat. Stand the tuna in the oil to cool. Once cool, remove the tuna from oil – it should be pink on the inside.
* To assemble, cut the rolls in half and spread the tomato paste evenly over both sides.
