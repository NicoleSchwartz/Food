## Ingredients, Other ingredients
* 10 ladi pav

## Directions, Make the garlic chutney
* Heat 2 teaspoons of oil in a pan on medium heat. Then add garlic cloves and fry for 1-2 minutes until garlic turns slightly brown in color. Set aside on a tissue.
* To the same pan, add freshly grated coconut. Cook for 2 minutes until light golden brown.
* Transfer coconut to a blender. Add toasted garlic, salt and red chili powder and grind to a coarse chutney. Set it aside.

## Directions, Make the green chutney
* To a blender add cilantro. Discard the hard stems, the softer ones are okay to use.
* Add green chili, garlic, cumin powder, salt, sugar (if using) and lime juice. Add 1 tbsp water or as needed. Blend to a fine paste and set it aside.

## Directions, Make the tamarind chutney
* To a pan add water, tamarind paste, jaggery, sugar, salt, red chili powder, cumin powder and ginger powder. Bring mixture to a boil.
* Reduce heat to medium and let it boil for 3-4 minutes until the chutney turns thick and coats the back of a spoon. Set it aside to cool. It will thicken more as it cools down.

## Directions, Make the vada
* Boil the potatoes until soft, peel them and set them aside. Using a mortar and pestle, crush the ginger, garlic and green chili. Set it aside.
* Heat 1 tablespoon oil in pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them pop. Then add the curry leaves and hing and mix.
* Add the crushed ginger-garlic-green chili. Cook for one minute until the ginger and garlic starts changing color.
* Now add the boiled potatoes and remove pan from heat. Add turmeric, salt and mash the potatoes using a potato masher. Add chopped cilantro and mix well.
* Now make lemon sized balls out of the potato mixture. I was able to get 10 of these. Set these aside.

## Directions, Make the batter to fry the vada
* To make the batter, take besan in a large bowl. Add turmeric, salt and pinch of baking soda to it. Start adding water, little by little to the bowl.
* Whisk to form a smooth batter. You may need couple of extra tablespoons of water to reach a desired consistency. The batter should neither be thick nor thin.

## Directions, Fry the vada
* Heat oil in a kadai/wok on medium-high heat. Dip each potato round into the batter, coat it from all sides. Then drop it carefully into the hot oil.
* Fry the vada in hot oil until golden brown in color. Fry all vadas in a similar way. Drain on a paper towel.

## Directions, Assemble the Vada Pav
* To assemble the vada pav, toast the pav with some butter on a pan. Then slice each pav but not entirely. It should still be attached at one end.
* Apply green chutney on one side and tamarind chutney on the other side of the pav. Then apply garlic chutney on top of these chutneys.
* Place the fried vada in the center. Serve the vada pav immediately with more chutney on the side!
