THE TOMATO SAUCE WITH THE SCENT OF ...... MINT!
(with spaghetti)

Ingredients for 4 people

5 auburn tomatoes
1 onion
8 mint leaves (4 cooking +4 to decorate)
salt
sugar
Extra virgin olive oil
Lemon peel
Ice

Wash the tomatoes
Make a cross incision using the petiole as the center
Dip them in boiling water for two minutes
Put the tomatoes in water and ice.
Cool them to fix the color. 
Peel the tomatoes. (put the skins aside) 

The tomatoes are five. Four are to be used for the sauce.
One for the garnish like this: cut it into slices into 8 parts, remove the seeds, bake it in an oven at 200 degrees for 10 minutes sprinkled with salt, sugar and extra virgin olive oil.
Tomatoes (4) for the sauce: chop the onion and brown it in a pan with extra virgin olive oil. Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes into small pieces, put them in the pan where you fried the onion, add salt and sugar. Insert the whole mint leaves for a few minutes and put the lid. Taste and if you like the aroma you like, remove the leaves, otherwise leave them a little longer.
(this trick to remove the leaves is necessary for the mint which could release a too strong aroma, if you use basil or oregano or thyme or marjoram it is not necessary, however tasting never hurts).
Finish cooking the sauce without the mint leaves.

Cooking is very fast.
Turn off the heat and pass the sauce at the vegetable mill and then set aside.
In a clean pan, low and wide, prepare a round of olive oil and add the sauce passed to the vegetable mill.
In the meantime, you have boiled the water for the pasta and when the pasta is half cooked, transfer it to the pan where the sauce is already hot, risottola with the cooking water until the end. Serve, garnish with some confit tomato flakes, a few strips of mint leaf and if you also like a grated lemon peel.

NB:
this technique is also excellent with other fragrances, basil, fresh oregano, fresh thyme, fresh marjoram etc.)
As written above with mint, be careful not to release too intense a flavor (however, tasting is always good)
