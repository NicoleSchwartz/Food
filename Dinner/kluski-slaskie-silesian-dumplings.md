## Ingredients
* 2 large russet potatoes, peeled and diced
* potato starch (1/4 volume of potatoes, see instructions)
* 1 egg
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Directions
* Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water, until tender
* Drain thoroughly and mash or rice
* Press the mashed potatoes into a bowl and smooth the top
* Draw two lines on the top of the potatoes, dividing the mass into fourths
* Scoop out 1/4 of the potatoes and fill this space with potato starch, return the potatoes you just scooped out
* Add egg and salt, stir until well combined
* Roll a small amount of the mixture, about the size of a golf ball, in your hands until smooth
* Make an indentation with your thumb and continue smoothing the dumpling
* Preparing a large pot of barely simmering salted water
* Without overcrowding the pot, place dumplings in water with a slotted spoon
* They will rise to the top after a few minutes, if a stubborn one or two stay on the bottom, give them a gentle nudge, they may be stuck
* Cook for 5 more minutes, remove with a slotted spoon
* Top with with whatever wonderful creation youâ€™re using
