## Ingredients, Pancake
* Japanese long yam (nagaimo) or mountain yam (yamaimo) 
* 4 extra large eggs
* 3/4-1 c flour
* 4-5 c shredded green cabbage
* 1 carrot
* ¼ tsp kosher/sea salt
* ¼ tsp sugar
* ¼ tsp baking powder
* 5.6 oz nagaimo/yamaimo (mountain yam) (2-3", 5-8 cm)
* ¾ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more)
* ½ cup tenkasu/agedama (tempura scraps)

## Ingredients, Topping
* Japanese Mayonnaise
* Okonomiyaki Sauce
* Tenkasu (tempura bits/scraps) 
* Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)
* Aonori (dried green seaweed)

## Ingredients, Sauce
* 1 ½ Tbsp sugar
* 2 Tbsp oyster sauce
* 4 Tbsp ketchup
* 3 ½ Tbsp Worcestershire sauce

## Directions
1. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup (120 g) all-purpose flour, ¼ tsp salt, ¼ tsp sugar, and ¼ tsp baking powder and mix all together.
1. Peel and grate nagaimo in a small bowl (I use this grater that I love). Note: I don't have any issues, but you may get itchy by touching nagaimo. Work quickly and rinse your hands immediately after. Nagaimo is very slimy and slippery, so make sure you have a good grip if you wear a kitchen glove. NOTE: i just fine diced a normal yam
1. Add the grated nagaimo and dashi in the bowl. NOTE: I used chicken broth
1. Mix all together till combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least one hour. Meanwhile, you can prepare the okonomiyaki sauce and other ingredients.
* make the sauce: Combine 1 ½ Tbsp sugar, 2 Tbsp oyster sauce, 4 Tbsp ketchup, and 3 ½ Tbsp Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl. Mix all together until sugar is completely dissolved.
* Discard the core of the cabbage and then mince the cabbage leaves.
* After one hour, take out the batter from the refrigerator. Add 4 large eggs, ½ cup (8 Tbsp) tempura scraps (tenkasu/agedama) in the bowl. Mix well until well-combined.
* Add chopped cabbage to the batter ⅓ at a time. Mix well before adding the rest.
* In a large pan, heat vegetable oil on medium heat. When the frying pan is hot (400ºF or 200ºC), spread the batter in a circle on the pan. We like thicker okonomiyaki (final thickness is ¾ inches or 2 cm). If you’re new to making okonomiyaki, make a smaller and thinner size so it’s easier to flip. cook covered for 5 minutes.
* When the bottom side is nicely browned, flip over.
* Gently press the okonomiyaki to fix the shape and keep it together. Cover and cook for another 5 minutes.
* Flip over one last time and cook uncovered for 2 minutes. If you’re going to cook the next batch, transfer to a plate.

## Attempt
December 2020 - used garnet yams instead could not get others. I should have diced the cabbage smaller though i think. I need a food processor.
