Cranberry Balsamic Roasted Chicken

Ingredients, Marinade:
* 1/3 cup cranberries (Sub: Canned cranberry saue, whole berry)
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 2 Tbsp tamari sauce
* 2 Tbsp maple syrup
* 1/4 c Balsamic vingegar
* 1/4 tsp salt and pepper (I did 1/8 salt 1/8 pepper)
* 2 garlic cloves (I did 3 large, minced not pressed)

Ingredients, Glaze:
* 1/4 c maple syrup
* 1/4 c Balsamic vinegar

Ingredients:
* 2.5 lbs chicken thighs, skin on (I did bonessless, skinless)
* 2-6 sprigs fresh thyme (I did way more than that)
* sprinkle italian herbs https://github.com/NicoleSchwartz/Food/blob/master/Spices/Italian_Herb_Blend.md
* 1/3-1/2 cup fresh cranberries (Sub: Canned cranberry saue, whole berry)

Directions:
* marinade chicken 30min - 24 hours
* bake chicken @ 375F for 25-30 min, then turn
* brush glaze over and add seasonings (thyme, herbs, cranberry)
* broil 3-4 min until golden brown

Notes:

* I actually probably did it wrong, I dumped the marinade in the pyrex dish with the chicken, baked, then flipped, dumped on glaze and seasoning, and broiled. But everyone liked it.
