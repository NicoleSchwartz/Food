FOCACCIA PUGLIESE 

Ingrediants :

250 gr. Durum wheat flour
350 gr. Flour 00
340 ml warm water
10 gr. sugar
10 gr. salt
150 gr. boiled potato
20 gr. Brewer's yeast
15 gr. Extra virgin olive oil

Dissolve the yeast in the water with the sugar, add the flour, the boiled potato previously mixed with the salt and the oil, mashed well with a fork.
Mix everything well until a smooth mass is obtained.
Leave to rise covered with a cloth for two hours.
Grease a pan well, distribute the dough (with greasy hands so it does not stick), press it lightly with your fingers and let it rise in the pan for 15 min. At pleasure, when you put the pasta in the pan you can stuff with cherry tomatoes (better confit) or slices of tomato and / or slices of boiled potato, onion slices, (all better if already cooked), a sprinkling of dried oregano , a little salt and plenty of olive oil.
These ingredients should be placed on top of the dough and then pressed well inside with your fingers, applying light pressure.
Leave to rise for 15 minutes and then bake.
Bake in a preheated oven at 200 degrees for 35 min.
(must be charred)
