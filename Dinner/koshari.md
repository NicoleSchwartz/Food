## Ingredients
* 2 1/2 cups of short grain rice.
* 1 package 16 oz dry Pasta, preferably Ditalini or elbow.
* 2 Tablespoon oil.
* Salt and Pepper to taste.
* 2 cups dry brown lentils.
* Water to cover lentils.
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil.
* 1 medium onion chopped.
* 1 can 16oz tomato sauce.
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin.
* Salt and pepper to taste.
* Vermicelli 
* chickpeas, cooked
* tomato sauce
* fried onion

## Ingredients, For the Cumin Sauce (Kamouneyah):
* 1 teaspoon garlic crushed.
* 1 Tablespoon ground cumin.
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil.
* 1/4 cup water.
* 1/4 cup vinegar.
* Salt.

## Directions
* Put lentils in a colander and wash with running cold water.
* Place lentils in a pot and cover with water 2-3 inches. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to minimum and simmer for 25-30 minutes until almost done. Drain.
* In the same pot add oil, chopped onion and suate until fragrant.
* Add semi-cooked lentils, cumin, salt and tomato sauce.
* Cook for 15 minutes on medium or until tender but not mushy. Set aside.
* Prepare short grain rice as directed on the package or in your rice cooker. Traditionally, short grain rice is used. Some people like using Basmati rice or even Jasmine rice, this is ok but not the traditional way to prepare this dish.
* Making Koshari with vermicelli is not traditional but highly recommended. I have a motto that anything is better with vermicelli. So go get some from the store and make it, you'll never regret it I promise.
* Roast vermicelli in some oil, then gradually add water until it absorbs the water and becomes tender and not clumpy or mushy. This steps depends greatly on the kind of vermicelli you are getting.
* Cook Pasta according to package directions, drain then mix in salt and pepper and oil.
* You should have soaked chickpeas overnight or if you forgot you can soak for an hour in hot water and baking soda.
* To make the tomato sauce: Saute garlic in oil until fragrant, about one minute. Add vinegar, tomato sauce, salt and pepper then bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes to thicken it a bit.
* To make cumin sauce: again we'll need to saute garlic and ground cumin in oil until fragrant, add vinegar, water and salt. This sauce will separate as it cools down, you'll notice that the cumin and garlic will stay at the bottom while water and vinegar rises to top. It is recommended to pour this sauce in a bottle and give it a good shake before using.
* Now we will prepare crispy onion by simply frying onion wedges in oil. Some people like powdering onions with flour or tossing them with salt first. I do not like that, and I come up with very crispy onion slices and you can hear that clear in the video... No salt... No flour. Just take them out on a plate with kitchen paper towel. Please see notes below for the use of the frying oil.
* Cook chickpeas by first draining the soaking water and washing them well then place in a pot, cover with water add some salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook 60-90 minutes until it reaches the desired tenderness.
* Assemble the dish by just adding and mixing everything together, or make them in a decorative way as shown above. Top with both sauces, cooked chickpeas and may be a sprinkle of cayenne powder
