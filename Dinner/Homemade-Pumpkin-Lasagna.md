Homemade Pumpkin Lasagna

## Ingredients
* 12 lasagna noodles
* 1 3/4-2 cups shredded firm mozzarella or (fontina or gruyere cheese) (400 grams)
* 1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese (33 grams)

### pumpkin mixture
* 4 cups pumpkin (fairytale or butternut squash) chopped small cubes (500 grams)
* 1 small shallot (or 1/2 an onion)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1-2 dashes black pepper

### white sauce
* 1/3 cup butter
* 1/3 cup all purpose flour
* 4 cups milk (I used 2%) (1 litre)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1-2 dashes black pepper
* 3-4 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan cheese

## Directions
* Pre-heat oven to 400F (200C).
* In a medium frying pan low/medium heat add the olive oil, chopped shallot, chopped pumpkin, salt and pepper, stir to combine then cover and let cook until tender approximately 10-15 minutes, stir often to make sure it doesn't burn. Set aside.
* In a medium pot on medium low heat, melt the butter, add the flour, salt and pepper stir until smooth then slowly add the milk, cook and stir constantly until it starts to thicken. Remove from the heat and add the pumpkin mixture and stir to combine. Bring the mixture back to a boil, stirring constantly for about a minute, remove from the heat then gently fold in 3-4 tablespoons of parmesan cheese.
* Drizzle 1-2 tablespoons on the bottom of a 11 x 7 inch (28x18cm) baking pan. Spread a spoonful or two of sauce on the bottom of the pan, top with a layer of noodles, then sauce, shredded cheese, grated parmesan and repeat for 3-4 layers (depending on how many layers the ingredients will be divided by 3 or 4). Drizzle a little olive oil on the top of the last layer and bake for approximately 15-20 minutes or until bubbly and golden on top. Let sit for 10-15 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
