Roasted Butternut Squash Salad with Warm Cider Vinaigrette

## Ingredients
* 1 (1 1/2-pound) butternut squash, peeled and 3/4-inch) diced
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
* 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 3 tablespoons dried cranberries
* 4 ounces baby arugula, washed and spun dry (sub: spring mix)
* 1/2 cup walnuts halves, toasted (didn't toast)
* 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan

## Ingredients, dressing
* 3/4 cup apple cider or apple juice
* 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
* 2 tablespoons minced shallots
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* 1/2 c olive oil
* 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Directions
* Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
* Place the butternut squash on a sheet pan. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, the maple syrup, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and toss. 
* Roast the squash for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once, until tender. Add the cranberries to the pan for the last 5 minutes.
* While the squash is roasting, combine the apple cider, vinegar, and shallots in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until the cider is reduced to about 1/4 cup. 
* Off the heat, whisk in the mustard, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.
* Place the arugula in a large salad bowl and add the roasted squash mixture, the walnuts, and the grated Parmesan. 
* Spoon just enough vinaigrette over the salad to moisten and toss well. 
* Serve immediately.
