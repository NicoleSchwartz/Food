## Ingredients, ravioli
* 2 T butter

* 1 garlic clove, minced (i used 2)
* 1 15-oz can pumpkin puree
* 1/4 c goat cheese, crumbled
* 3 T olive oil
* salt and pepper
* wonton wrappers, cut into quarters (I used full wrappers uncut and 1 tsp barely fit)
* idea: try nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, clove and allspice

## Ingredients, sauce
* 6 T butter
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp sage, chopped
* 2 T heavy cream
* idea: add flour
* idea: add peacans

## Ingredients, toppings
* 1 c arugula
* 1/2 c parmesan cheese, grated
* 1/4 c toasted peacans, chopped

## Directions
* saute leeks and garlic and 2 T butter
* remove from heat, combine with pumpkin and goat cheese
* add olive oil, salt, pepper.

* lay wonton wrappers on a floured surface
* place 1 tsp filling on half the squares
* brush water around the edges of the pumpkin topped wontons
* press a empty wonton square on each topped wonton square, crimp edges with a fork
* boil ravioli for 3-4 min, or until tender

meanwhile
* melt butter in a small skillet, over low heat
* add salt, sage, stir in heavy cream

* toss finished ravioli in the sauce
* serve with arugula, cheese and pecans

## Notes
* The above made 6 people-dinners and might make 4-8 more. i recommend halving it at least - or freezing a bunch for future use.

## Attempt
* 2021-02-11 - fried wontons b/c didn't seal well and boiling would have resulted in soup - too crispy, hubs didn't think they were pumpkin-y enough. Sauce was very thin. used 2 cloves garlic. Next time might bake the wontons, and might flour the sauce so it's thicker, might also put peacans in the sauce. Also probably more sage. might also consider nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, clove and allspice.
* 2021-02-13 - started sauce with roux (1 TB butter to 2 TB flour) this time and baked them in a 400F oven ~7-8 min, there were better, but still would prefer pasta to wonton wrapper and think next time a bit of pumpkin spice. i froze a bunch and need to make more and freeze more out of the remianing filling. I also put hella lot more fresh sage (like 3 Tb+) in.
