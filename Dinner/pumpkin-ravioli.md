## Attempt
* 2021-02-11 - fried wontons b/c didn't seal well and boiling would have resulted in soup - too crispy, hubs didn't think they were pumpkin-y enough. Sauce was very thin. used 2 cloves garlic. Next time might bake the wontons, and might flour the sauce so it's thicker, might also put peacans in the sauce. Also probably more sage. might also consider nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, clove and allspice.
