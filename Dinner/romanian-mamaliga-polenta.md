## Directions, polenta
* To make it start with some boiling water, Water ratio for polenta is usually use 4 times of water to cornmeal but 3-time water to cornmeal for sturdy.
  * Soft: Cornmeal - 400g; Water - 1.6L
  * Medium: Cornmeal - 400g; Water - 1.5L
  * Stiff: Cornmeal - 500g; Water - 1.5L
* First Add some salt for taste. 
* Add the cornmeal into the water. Remember to stir it vigorously while pouring the cornmeal
* Let it cook for 15 minutes in slow heat. 
* Just stir occasionally so it cooks evenly. 
* Towards the end add some butter or olive oil Then give it a good mix and let it sit on the pan on high heat for 30 seconds . 
* High heat forms a nice crust at the bottom and comes off the pan very easily. 
* Then take it out of the pan.

* see how many g 1/2 c cornmeal is and adjust above (estimate 1/2c = single serving per internet search)

## Attempt
* 2021-02-09 - 200g cornmeal to 3 and 1/3 c water - ended up adding some more water next time maybe 3.5? 3.75? - it was tasty, but bland, boring - perhaps a better breakfast or lunch? 200g way too much for 2 people
