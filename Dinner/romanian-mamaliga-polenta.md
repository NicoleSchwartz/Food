## Directions, polenta
* To make it start with some boiling water, Water ratio for polenta is usually use 4 times of water to cornmeal but I always do 3-time water to cornmeal and it gives a nice sturdy #polenta.
* First Add some salt for taste. Then simply add the cornmeal In the water. 
* cooking half a kilo which is half of this packet. 
* Remember to stir it vigorously while pouring the cornmeal and then let it cook for 15 minutes in slow heat. 
* Just stir occasionally so it cooks evenly. 
* Towards the end add some butter or olive oil Then give it a good mix and let it sit on the pan on high heat for 30 seconds . 
* High heat forms a nice crust at the bottom and comes off the pan very easily. 
* Thatâ€™s it than just simply take it out of the pan and as you can see how sturdy this polenta is. 
* If you want a thinner version of polenta just choose the different water ratio.
