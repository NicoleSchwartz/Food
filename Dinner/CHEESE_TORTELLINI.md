CHEESE TORTELLINI

## Ingredients For the dough:
 * 3 1/3 cups (519 grams) all purpose flour
 * 4 large eggs, room temperature
 * 1/4 teaspoon salt
 * 1/4 cup (75 ml) olive oil
 
## Ingredients For the filling:
 * 8 ounces (250 grams) fresh ricotta
 * 1 extra large egg
 * 1/2 cup (45 grams) Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
 * 2 tablespoons fresh spinach, chopped
 * 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
 * 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
 * Small pinch of nutmeg, freshly grated
 * 1 egg, beaten with 1 teaspoon water for egg wash

## Directions
### To make the dough:
* On a clean work surface, make a mound with the flour and create a well in the middle and add the eggs, salt and olive oil. This can also be done in a large mixing bowl.
* Using a fork, beat the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour from the inner rim of the mound, making sure the mound stays intact with the other hand. The dough will start to come together. Start to drizzle in 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup (about 50 ml) water. You may not use it all, you just need to dough moist enough to come together in a ball. You can use your hands at this point. The dough should stay together, not be dry and not be to sticky to handle.
* Knead for about 3 minutes on a lightly floured surface until smooth.
* Once the dough is nice and soft and smooth, wrap it in plastic wrap, making sure it is well wrapped so no areas of the dough dry out. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to rest.
### To make the filling:
* To a mixing bowl, add all the ingredients until well incorporated. Set aside.
* Directions for using a pasta maker:
* Dust your work surface with flour. Cut a 1/4 piece of the dough, keep the unused portion of the dough well covered until ready to use ( If you are not using the rest of the dough, wrap it well and freeze) Flatten the piece of dough with your hands into a small rectangle in preparation for passing through a pasta machine.
* With your pasta machine on the widest setting (usually 1), pass the dough through 2 or 3 times, guiding with your hands as it comes out, keeping it flat. If the dough gets sticky, dust with flour.
* Reduce the setting by 1 until you get to 4 (which on my machine is the perfect thickness).
### Directions for using a rolling pin:
* Dust your work surface with flour. Cut a 1/4 piece of the dough, keep the unused portion of the dough well covered until ready to use (If you are not using the rest of the dough, wrap it well and freeze) Flatten the piece of dough with your hands into a small rectangle. Roll the dough as thin as possible (but not so that it will break when filled).
* Once you have your dough to the right thickness, use a 2 inch (5 cm) round cookie cutter or drinking glass and cut out circles.
* Brush half of the edges of the rounds closest to you with the egg wash. Add 1/4 teaspoon of the ricotta mixture to the center of each. Fold the egg wash half of the circle over the ricotta to meet the other side. Bring the corners around to the bottom to meet and stick them together using egg wash.
* On an empty shelf of your freezer, spread out parchment paper and put the tortellini in a single layer, without touching and freeze for 1 hour. This makes them easy to handle and they wont stick together.
* Transfer the tortellini to a freezer bag or container and either store them in the freezer, or if you are using them right away, cook in simmering water until they float to the top, about 5-7 minutes and serve with your favorite sauce.
