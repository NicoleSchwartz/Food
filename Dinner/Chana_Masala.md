## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups dry chickpeas, (soaked in water 12-24 hours or see notes)  or sub 4-5 cups cooked or canned chickpeas
* 3 tablespoons ghee or coconut oil. ( GHEE elevates this to the next level of goodness!!!)
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 teaspoons  cumin seeds (whole)
* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 2 onions, diced
* 4 fat garlic cloves, rough chopped
* 1/2 –1 jalapeno or 1 serrano chili, finely diced
* 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1/2 teaspoon chili powder or paprika
* 1 teaspoon dried fenugreek leaves(optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 2 medium tomatoes, diced (and their juices) or 14-ounce can tomato puree, (although fresh tastes better here)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt (taste, use more if dry chickpeas, less if canned)
* 2 cups water if using dry, soaked chickpeas  (or 1/2 cup water if using if canned or fully cooked chickpeas)
* 1 teaspoon honey or sugar if needed
* Serve over Basmati Rice or with naan bread! Serve with [pickled onions](https://github.com/NicoleSchwartz/Food/blob/master/components/Quick_Pickled_Onions.md), and [raita](https://github.com/NicoleSchwartz/Food/blob/master/components/Indian_Raita.md).
* bell pepper
* summer squash

## Directions
* If using dry beans, soak chickpeas in a bowl with 6 cups water, for 8-12 hours on counter, or up to 24 hours in the fridge. Drain. (See notes for quick instant pot “soak”)
* Set Instant pot to Saute function. (See notes for stovetop.)Heat ghee and add whole bay leaves and cumin seeds  and fennel seeds stirring 2-3 minutes until fragrant and golden.
* Add onions. Saute 5-7 minutes until golden. You really want these to deeply caramelize so they add a nice sweetness. Add garlic, ginger and diced chili, saute 2-3 minutes.
* Add all the spices- garam masala, ground cumin, coriander, chili powder, fenugreek, turmeric.
* Give a stir then add the tomatoes and their juices, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes, scraping up any browned bits.
* Once the tomatoes start to break down add the water (if using dry chickpeas), salt, and drained chickpeas. Give a good stir, scraping up any browned bits ( to prevent burn error).
* Set Instant to High Pressure for 25 minutes. (SEE NOTES!!!) Naturally, release for 15 minutes then manually release.
* Taste and adjust salt. If it tastes bitter, add a little sugar or honey  ( 1-2 teaspoons) to help balance.
* If you want it more flavorful, stir in another teaspoon of garam masala, or if you want extra richness, a splash of coconut milk is nice.

## Notes

* Remember dry chickpeas will need more salt, canned chickpeas perhaps less salt.

### Instant Pot Cooking Times:
* If using soaked chickpeas (12-hour soaking method-my prefered method), pressure cook Chana Masala for 25 minutes.
* If using unsoaked chickpeas (which I really don’t recommend) pressure cook Chana Masala on high for 55 minutes. Naturally release. (Be aware, they may not cook evenly- especially if they are older beans)
* How to “pre-soak” chickpeas in the Instant pot: place 1 1/2 cups dry chickpeas, 4 cups water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Set to High pressure for 15 minutes. Manual or natural release. Drain, set chickpeas aside and wipe out the Instant Pot. Follow the recipe and pressure cook the chana masala for 40 minutes.
* If using canned chickpeas, set instant pot to 6 minutes, add only 1/2 cup water,  manually release.

### STOVE TOP:
* In a large pot or dutch oven, over medium-high heat, heat ghee and add whole bay leaves and cumin seeds  and fennel seeds stirring 1-2 minutes until fragrant and golden. Add onions. Saute 5-7 minutes until golden, lowering the heat to medium. You really want these to deeply caramelize so they add a nice sweetness. Add garlic, ginger and diced chili, saute 2-3 minutes.
* Add all the spices- garam masala, ground cumin, coriander, chili powder, fenugreek, turmeric.
* Give a stir then add the tomatoes and their juices, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes, scraping up any browned bits. Once the tomatoes start to break down add the water,  salt, and dry, soaked chickpeas. Give a good stir, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to a boil, cover, simmer gently until chickpeas are tender, about 40 minutes. Taste and adjust salt. If it tastes bitter, add a little sugar or honey to balance.
* Or, make this on the stovetop with canned chickpeas, following the same directions, only adding  1/4- 1/2 cup water, simmering on low, for 10-15 minutes.
