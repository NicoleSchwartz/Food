## Ingredients
* 5 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
* 3 medium-size apples, halved, cored, and sliced (3 cups)
* 2 large onions, thinly sliced (2 cups)
* 6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper
* 1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* 2 tablespoons brandy or apple cider

## Directions
* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 2-quart baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter.
* Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the apples and onions and saute until the apples are tender, about 10 minutes. Spoon into the baking dish.
* Rub the chicken with the salt and pepper and arrange over the apple-onion mixture. Combine the cheeses with the bread crumbs and thyme and sprinkle the mixture over the chicken. * Drizzle the brandy over the cheese. Bake for 40 minutes or until the cheese is golden brown and the chicken is done.
