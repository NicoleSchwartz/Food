Pandan Waffles – Bánh Kẹp Lá Dứa

- 1 cup self raising flour. If using all purpose flour / plain flour instead of self raising flour, add in 1 tsp of baking powder for every 1 cup of flour.
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 tbsp cornstarch / cornflour - Cornstarch can be substituted with tapioca starch or rice flour.
- 1 cup coconut milk - We use canned coconut milk, but you can also use coconut cream which is just a bit thicker in texture.
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 egg
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 tsp vanilla essence
- 1/2 tsp pandan flavouring

1. Add the self raising flour, sugar, cornstarch, coconut milk and regular milk into a bowl and give everything a good stir.
2. Then add the egg, vanilla essence, pandan flavouring and melted butter and stir until combined. The batter should be nice and thick.
3. We recommend serving with drizzles of condensed milk, which is a thick sweet syrup that goes perfectly with waffles! Condensed milk is usually sweetened, so you don’t need to use much.
