## Ingredients
* 200 g instant couscous
* 350 ml orange juice
* 100 g dried fruit of your choice such as dried dates, apricots, cranberries, etc. - I used raisins and figs but figs were too sweet
* 1 tsp rose or orange blossom water - optional, i skip

### For serving
* 80 g nuts of your choice such as almonds, pistachios, pecans, etc. - I used walnuts
* plain yogurt
* liquid sweetener of your choice such as honey, agave, maple syrup, etc. - I skipped
* spices: cinnamon - I used [poudre douce](https://food52.com/recipes/32717-poudre-douce) and salt

## Directions
* The night before serving cut the dried fruit into bite size pieces and combine in a bowl with instant couscous, orange juice, orange blossom water/rose water (if using). Let soak in the fridge overnight.
* The next morning roast the nuts either on the stove or in the oven, then roughly chop. Meanwhile fluff up the couscous with a fork and add more orange juice if you find it is a tad dry. All of the liquid should be nicely absorbed, no liquid should sit at the bottom of the bowl.
* Serve portions in small bowls, add yogurt, your sweetener, sprinkle on spice and the nuts. Enjoy!
