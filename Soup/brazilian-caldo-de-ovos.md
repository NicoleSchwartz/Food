## Ingredients
 * 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
 * ½ yellow onion, chopped
 * 2 tablespoons chopped bell pepper (any color) 
 * 4 garlic cloves, minced
 * 1 tablespoon minced biquinho chili pepper (or another mild chili pepper) 
 * ¾ pound (350 grams) lean ground beef 
 * 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
 * 2 beef bouillon cubes, crumbled
 * 1 teaspoon urucum (or paprika)
 * 1 teaspoon ground cumin
 * ½ teaspoon ground black pepper 
 * 4 tablespoons tomato extract
 * 8 cups (2 liters) water
 * 4-6 eggs
 * 1 cup (125 grams) fine grind cassava flour (sub: corn meal)
 * Juice from ½ of a lime 
 * 1 handful chopped cilantro (or parsley)

## Directions
* Mix the Worcestershire sauce, onion, bell pepper, garlic and biquinho pepper with the ground beef in a bowl and set aside. 
* In a stockpot, heat olive oil over high heat, and sauté the ground beef. Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow to cook for about 5 minutes or until the beef has browned but is still moist.
* Add bouillon cubes, ground cumin, black pepper and urucum (or paprika) to the pot and stir, cooking for another 5 minutes or so, until most of the liquid from the beef and vegetables has evaporated. Add the tomato paste and stir to combine.  
* Add 6 cups (1 ½ liters) of water and stir, removing any bits that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan with a spoon. 
* Once the soup comes to a boil, lower the heat back to medium-low and break the eggs into the pot, slowly stirring with a spoon so they cook as stringy pieces. Ideally, you’ll have one cooked yolk per person, which is why we indicate a range of eggs in the ingredients list.  
* In a bowl, mix the cassava flour with the remaining 2 cups (500 ml) of water, and with a spoon, slowly add the flour and water mix to the pot, stirring with each spoonful, so it does not clump. Keep stirring for another 5 minutes or until the flour has fully cooked. If you do get clumps, press them against the edge of the pot to disintegrate them. It’s okay if you’re left with some smaller balls of flour at the end, focus on breaking up the bigger ones. 
* Turn off the heat and add the lime juice and chopped cilantro. Taste and adjust seasoning and salt. Stir and serve hot in bowls, topped with chopped scallions, or more cilantro, or add a spoonful of dried or roasted cassava flour or farofa for some crunch.
