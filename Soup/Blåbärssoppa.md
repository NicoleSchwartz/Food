blueberry soup

## Ingredients
* 350 g	(3 cups)	blueberries, fresh or defrosted (or use bilberries if you can)
* 4 tbsp caster (superfine) sugar
* 700 ml (3 cups)	water
* 1½ tbsp potato flour (starch)

## Directions
* Pick over the blueberries, removing any stalks and shrivelled berries. Rinse and drain.
* Place the berries in a saucepan with the sugar and water, but don’t forget to save some berries for the garnish. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Simmer steadily for 15 to 30 minutes until the berries are soft and disintegrating.
* Remove the mixture from the heat. Mix the potato flour (starch) with a little water and then pour it into the blueberry soup in a steady stream. Return to a gentle heat, stirring continuously until thickened slightly.
* Taste and add more sugar if desired.
* The hot soup can be poured into a vacuum flask and served warm later.
* In summer it is normally served cold. In this case sprinkle a little icing sugar (confectioner’s sugar) over the top as it helps to prevent a skin forming.
