Italian Stracciatella Soup

## Ingredients
* 4 cups broth (chicken, beef or vegetable) (940 grams)
* 3 large eggs
* Â½ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese (50 grams)
* 1 dash nutmeg* (if desired)

## Directions
* In a medium to large pot bring the broth to a boil.
* In a small bowl beat together the eggs then add the parmesan cheese, and nutmeg (if desired). Beat until well combined. If you don't like nutmeg then a sprinkling of lemon zest before serving is also favourite with Romans.
* Add the egg mixture to the boiling broth in a slow steady stream while mixing with a whisk, let cook for about 3-4 minutes. Once the mixture boils again*, give it another whisk and then serve. Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley or more parmesan cheese if desired.
