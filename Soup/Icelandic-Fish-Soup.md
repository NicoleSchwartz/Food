Fiskisúpa, Icelandic Fish Soup

## Ingredients
* 500g of Arctic Char (or Salmon)
* 500g of Haddock (or Cod or Plaice)
* 1     Large Yellow Onion
* 1     Large Leek
* 1     Celeriac (Celery Root)
* 5     Tomatos
* 500 ml of 18% Cream
* 1    Can of Tomato Puree
* 2     Handfuls of fresh Chives
* 3     Tablespoons of Red Wine Vinegar
* 2     Tablespoons of Port or Sherry (I used Pear Cognac)
* 3     Tablespoons of Dry Red Wine
* 3     Tablespoons of Butter and enough Vegetable Bouillon to handle three litres of water.
* Heavy Cream for garnish

## Directions
* Finely dice the onion and leek. In a large pot, lightly sauté onion and leek in butter until soft. Add the sherry and red wine. Reduce for 4 minutes.
* Don’t let celeriac’s freakish exterior intimidate you.
* Peel and julienne your celeriac. Add the celeriac and tomato puree to the pot and sauté for 4 minutes until soft.
* Add 3 litres of  water with vegetable bouillon and toss in the red wine vinegar. Boil for 15 minutes. Thinly dice up the tomatoes.
* Skin the arctic char and set the skin off to the side. Cube all the fish (arctic char and haddock)
* Add the tomatoes and fish. Let simmer for 5 minutes. Add the 18% cream and season well. Let simmer for 5 minutes. Don’t boil. Serve in a big bowl with a drizzle of cream and sprinkle on some fresh chives. Goes great with sour dough bread and crispy fish skin (fry the skin you saved earlier in a pan with oil and sprinkle with salt).
