Ertesuppe (Split Pea Soup)

## Ingredients
* 1½ lb (680 g) dried green split peas
* 2½ Tbsp (36 g) unsalted butter
* 3 lg carrots, peeled and finely diced
* 1 lg yellow onion, finely diced
* 4 cloves garlic, crushed
* 4 oz (120 g) ham, finely diced
* 8 C (1890 ml) low sodium chicken broth
* 6–8 C (1420–1890 ml) water
* Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Directions
* Soak peas overnight. 
* The next day, drain and rinse. 
* Place butter in a large saucepan over medium low; add carrots, onion, garlic and ham and cook, stirring frequently, 12 minutes. 
* Add peas, stirring to combine. Cook, stirring often, 8 minutes. 
* Add chicken broth and 6 cups (1420 ml) water. 
* Bring to a boil over high; then reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently to prevent the bottom from burning, about 1 hour 10 minutes or until peas are very tender, skimming and discarding any scum that forms, and adding additional water if soup thickens too quickly. 
* Remove about a third of the soup; cool 10 minutes; purée in a blender and return to soup, stirring to combine. 
* Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley and ham before serving.
