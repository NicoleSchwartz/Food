pasta dough
The basic dough recipe we used in our Class is as follows:

## Ingredients
* 1 hg flour 00
* 1 whole egg

It is also possible to use durum wheat semolina together with flour 00 with the following proportion:

* 1 whole egg
* 50g 00 flour + 50g durum wheat semolina

## Directions
* The method we have seen is the following:
* Place the flour on the pastry board, prepare a hole (volcano type) with your fingers and insert the eggs. With. With the help of a fork, mix the eggs into the flour until completely absorbed. Then work with your hands until the mixture is smooth and homogeneous.
* Cover under a bowl or covered with cling film for at least 20 minutes.

## Notes
* Do not use salt in the dough because the salt tends to oxidize and because we do not know what sauce we will season the pasta with (it could be a particularly tasty sauce and therefore salted pasta would be a problem)
* Open the eggs in a separate bowl to make sure they are okay
* The eggs must not be cold from the fridge but at room temperature
* Fresh pasta is best worked on wood
* Eggs ü•ö of yellow flesh color the pasta in a natural way (depends on what the hens eat üêì, corn üåΩ)
* The pasta must rest under a bowl (as it was once done) or covered with a film; To be tastier, the dough needs time, so slow processing and long rest. The rest can be done at least 20 minutes at room temperature or even in the fridge if you use it a long time after. Before use, take it out of the fridge and let the dough reach room temperature, then calculate the times well.
* It is possible to freeze small parts of dough (about 1.5 / 2 hg) in the freezer for a month. The important thing is that you defrost it in the refrigerator and only then should it be brought to room temperature before processing.
