## White Flour Ingredients
* 3 1/2 to 4 cups bread flour, plus more for rolling
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 envelope instant dry yeast
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 1/2 cups water, 110 degrees F
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons

## White Flour Directions
* Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. 
* While the mixer is running, add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. 
* If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. 
* If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. 
* Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.
* Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 hour. (bulk ferment)
* Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. 
* Cover each with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.
* Cook’s Note - Using bread flour will give you a much crisper crust. If you can't find bread flour, you can substitute it with all-purpose flour which will give you a chewier crust.

| 4g         | 5g         | 1g        | sugar      |

I make the 5 servings size in a bowl, mix, then divide into five 104.4g dry bags for easy dough making in the future.

Tricks:

Use cold tap water & refridgerate dough if you want to delay its rise.

## Whole Wheat
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon instant yeast
* 1 1/2 cups (354 grams) warm water (105 to 115 degrees)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for greasing and brushing
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1 teaspoon salt
* About 3 cups (407 grams) whole-wheat flour, plus more for dusting

## Whole Wheat Directions
* Step 1 Combine the sugar, yeast, warm water, tablespoon of oil, honey and salt in a stand mixer fitted with a dough-hook attachment. Mix on low speed for 30 seconds. Add all but about 1/3 cup of the whole-wheat flour; mix on low speed until a dough starts to come together.
* Step 2 Increase the speed to medium-low; continue to mix for about 5 minutes. If your dough is looking very wet and almost pourable, add some of the reserved 1/3 cup of flour, a tablespoon or two at a time. Continue to mix, adding more flour as needed, until the dough begins to gather around the dough hook and looks stretchy as it pulls away from the sides of the bowl; this may take as long as 15 minutes. It will not form a ball or pull away from the bowl completely. The dough may look very wet, but all will be well.
* Step 3 To test whether your dough is ready, pinch a small piece of dough away with your fingertips. If it breaks immediately as you stretch it, keep kneading. If it seems elastic and comes away from the rest of the dough in a stretchy, almost translucent sheet, that means the gluten has sufficiently formed.
* Step 4 Lightly grease a separate mixing bowl with oil. Shape the wet, sticky dough into a ball as best you can, then transfer it to the bowl, turning the dough over to coat it on all sides. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm environment for about 2 hours, or until it has about doubled in size. (A closed microwave where you have just heated some water for a minute or two works well.)
* Step 5 About 90 minutes into the rise, position a rack 4 to 6 inches from the broiler element of the oven; preheat the oven to 500 degrees or whatever its highest numbered temperature setting is. The oven should preheat for at least 30 minutes.
* Step 6 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, then generously dust it with flour.

Gently deflate the dough to release trapped air. Divide the dough into three portions, about 250 grams each. Roll each portion into a ball and then place them on baking sheet. Loosely cover with lightly greased plastic wrap and let the dough rest for at least 20 minutes, and up to 1 hour.

(After this rest, you may freeze the dough portions for up to 3 months.)

* Step 7 Generously flour your work surface. Transfer one ball of dough there and sprinkle more flour on top of the dough. (If you plan to use all the portions of dough right away, keep them covered.) Use your fingertips to start flattening the dough into a round. Continue to gently stretch the dough until you have a round about 10 inches in diameter, frequently rotating it and flouring the counter or dough as needed so nothing sticks.
* Step 8 Open the oven door for 10 seconds if you have an electric oven (this lets some heat escape to make sure the broiler will actually turn on even though the oven has reached its maximum temperature), and then turn on the broiler (to high, if that is an option). Have your pizza toppings ready to go nearby.
* Step 9 Preheat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet on the stove top, over medium heat, for 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully transfer the dough to the skillet, smoothing it into place with your hands or by sliding and shaking the skillet (use a folded towel or oven mitt since it will be very hot). Allow the dough to start to cook and dry out on bottom (a minute or less; you’ll see it looking less wet and starting to puff).
* Step 10 Add your toppings, leaving a 1/2- to 3/4-inch border around the edges. Brush the edges of the crust with oil, then sprinkle them with the Parmigiano-Reggiano, if using. Give the dough an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute to cook; this will help ensure the bottom of the crust will be crisped.
* Step 11 Use oven mitts to transfer the skillet to the oven. Broil the pizza for 3 to 5 minutes, rotating front to back halfway through, until the crust looks puffed and browned. Don’t walk away. A little charring on the crust or toppings is okay, but even a few seconds too much will burn the pizza. Remove the skillet from the oven, then use tongs to transfer the pizza to a wire rack to cool for a few minutes. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board. Cut into slices and serve right away.

* It turned out too thick and poofy, so my twitter friends had the below suggestions:
* https://www.kingarthurflour.com/learn/high-altitude-baking.html
* Did you do a window pane test to make sure the gluten was developed when you first mixed/kneaded the dough? https://lifehacker.com/use-the-windowpane-test-to-tell-if-your-dough-is-proper-1789963601
* Did you bulk ferment, portion and pre-shape, rest, and then shape the dough?
* Was the dough overworked?
* usually use a teaspoon dry yeast to 6 cups of flour for a NY style pizza dough 
* cold proof it wrapped in plastic in a refrigerator for a minimum of 24 hours.

## Attempt
* 1 - whole wheat using white recipie - too thick and doughy
* 2- whole wheat using richards recipie - When i let it rise in a 100F oven it worked much better, it was also warmer out
