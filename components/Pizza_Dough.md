Ingredients
* 3 1/2 to 4 cups bread flour, plus more for rolling
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 envelope instant dry yeast
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 1/2 cups water, 110 degrees F
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons

Directions
* Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. 
* While the mixer is running, add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. 
* If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. 
* If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. 
* Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.
* Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 hour. (bulk ferment)
* Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. 
* Cover each with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.
* Cookâ€™s Note - Using bread flour will give you a much crisper crust. If you can't find bread flour, you can substitute it with all-purpose flour which will give you a chewier crust.

* It turned out too thick and poofy, so my twitter friends had the below suggestions:
* https://www.kingarthurflour.com/learn/high-altitude-baking.html
* Did you do a window pane test to make sure the gluten was developed when you first mixed/kneaded the dough? https://lifehacker.com/use-the-windowpane-test-to-tell-if-your-dough-is-proper-1789963601
* Did you bulk ferment, portion and pre-shape, rest, and then shape the dough?
* Was the dough overworked?
* usually use a teaspoon dry yeast to 6 cups of flour for a NY style pizza dough 
* cold proof it wrapped in plastic in a refrigerator for a minimum of 24 hours.

Richard's Pizza dough recipe by weight.

| 5 servings | 1 serving | ingredient |
|------------|-----------| -----------|
| 500g       |  100g     | white flour |
| 325g       | 65g       | 110f water |
| 10g        | 2g        | salt       |
| 7g         | 1.4g      | dry active yeast |
| 5g         | 1g        | sugar      |

I make the 5 servings size in a bowl, mix, then divide into five 104.4g dry bags for easy dough making in the future.

Tricks:

Use cold tap water & refridgerate dough if you want to delay its rise.
