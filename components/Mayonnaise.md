# No Egg

## Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1/2 cup soy milk (or other milk like almond)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon mustard
* 6 tablespoons vegetable oil (any variety)

## Directions
* Combine everything except for the oil in a blender. Blend on the lowest speed just until well mixed.
* Then, very slowly and gradually—just one or two drops at a time—add the oil until the mixture starts to thicken. You can also use a food processor if needed, but you'll have to be patient. Making homemade mayonnaise is easier with a blender or food processor, but you can use a whisk if you need to. Your wrist and your upper arm may get tired from all the manual whisking.
* Continue blending until the mixture is thickened, creamy and smooth. Note that the mixture will also thicken up a little bit as it chills.
* Transfer your mayo to a jar and store in the refrigerator. Allow your homemade vegan mayo to chill for at least one hour before you use it. 

## Notes

* If you're using a blender which isn't very powerful, or a small low-powered chopper or food processor, you might run into a bit of trouble. You need a very powerful motor in order to really whip the oil to get your homemade mayonnaise thick and creamy like a store-bought mayo, otherwise, it may stay a bit thin and watery.
